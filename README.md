# VALORANT Statistics Recorder
Currently, the project records your score when practing in the VALORANT Shooting Range. After attempting to shoot 30 bots, your score is recorded into a file, and the average per week is calculated. The project is intended to keep track of personal improvements when practicing in the range.

The project uses the following concepts to accurately obtain the score from the range:
* optical character recognition (OCR)
* OpenCV color detection

Future plans for the program include:
* Track overshooting/undershooting when aiming at the bots.
